=========================================

Arduino Board Layout:
+---------------------+
|                     |
|  [RPM Sensor] → 2   |  // Interrupt pin
|                     |
|  [Mode Switch] → 3  |  // LOW = Tuning, HIGH = Production
|                     |
|  [PWM to ESC] ← 9   |  // PWM output
|                     |

|  [Ki Pot] → A2      |
|  [Kd Pot] → A3      |
+---------------------+

Connections:
-----------

RPM Sensor:
- Signal wire → Arduino Pin 2
- Power → 5V (or sensor voltage)
- Ground → GND

Mode Switch:
- One side → Arduino Pin 3
- Other side → GND (when closed = tuning mode)

PWM Output to ESC:
- Arduino Pin 9 → ESC signal input
- ESC power and motor connections as per ESC manual

Potentiometers (4x 10kΩ linear):
- Target RPM: Wiper → A0, ends → GND and 5V
- Kp: Wiper → A1, ends → GND and 5V
- Ki: Wiper → A2, ends → GND and 5V
- Kd: Wiper → A3, ends → GND and 5V

Power Supply:
- Arduino: USB or external 7-12V
- Motor/ESC: Separate supply as required by motor
- Common ground between Arduino and motor supply

Sensor Types:
------------

Hall Effect Sensor:
- Typically 3 wires: Power, Ground, Signal
- Rising edge on signal pin per magnet pass

Optical Encoder:
- Power, Ground, Channel A (use as signal)
- Quadrature encoders have Channel B for direction

Tachometer Wire (from ESC):
- Some ESCs provide RPM signal output
- Usually 1 pulse per revolution
- Check ESC documentation for voltage levels

Wiring Notes:
------------

1. Use shielded cable for RPM sensor if experiencing noise
2. Keep PWM wires away from sensor wires to prevent interference
3. Use appropriate wire gauge for motor power (ESC requirements)
4. Add pull-up resistor (4.7kΩ) on RPM sensor if signal is weak
5. Ground planes should be connected between Arduino and ESC

Calibration:
-----------

ESC Calibration (if required):
1. Disconnect motor from ESC
2. Power on ESC
3. Send full throttle PWM (255) for 2 seconds
4. Send zero throttle PWM (0) for 2 seconds
5. ESC should beep to confirm calibration

RPM Sensor Calibration:
- Adjust PULSES_PER_REV constant based on sensor type
- Hall sensors: Usually 1-2 pulses per revolution
- Encoders: Varies (check datasheet)
- Tachometer: Usually 1 pulse per revolution

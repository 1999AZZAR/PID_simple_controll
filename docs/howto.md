### ATtiny85 Wiring

#### Production Circuit

| Component | ATtiny85 Pin | Physical Pin | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| Hall Sensor Output | PB3 | Pin 2 | External interrupt INT0 |
| ESC PWM Input | PB0 | Pin 5 | Timer0 PWM output |
| VCC (5V) | VCC | Pin 8 | Power supply positive |
| Ground | GND | Pin 4 | Power supply ground |

```

#### Programming Wiring (Arduino as ISP)

| ATtiny85 | Physical Pin | Arduino Uno | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| MOSI | Pin 5 (PB0) | Pin 11 | ISP data to ATtiny |
| MISO | Pin 6 (PB1) | Pin 12 | ISP data from ATtiny |
| SCK | Pin 7 (PB2) | Pin 13 | ISP clock |
| RESET | Pin 1 | Pin 10 | ISP reset |
| VCC | Pin 8 | 5V | Power during programming |
| GND | Pin 4 | GND | Ground |
| - | - | RESET-GND | 10µF capacitor (positive to RESET) |

**Important**: 10µF capacitor between Arduino Reset and GND prevents Arduino from resetting during ISP.

### ESP32-C3 Wiring

#### With 3.3V Hall Sensor (Direct Connection)

| Component | ESP32-C3 Pin | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Hall Sensor Output (3.3V) | GPIO 0 | Connect directly |
| ESC PWM Input | GPIO 1 | Connect directly |
| Hall Sensor VCC | 3.3V | Power from ESP32 |
| Hall Sensor GND | GND | Common ground |
| ESC GND | GND | Common ground |

#### With 5V Hall Sensor (Voltage Divider Required)

**Voltage Divider Calculation**:
- Input: 5V Hall sensor signal
- Output: ~3V to GPIO 0 (safe for ESP32)
- R1 = 2.2kΩ, R2 = 3.3kΩ
- Vout = 5V × (3.3kΩ / (2.2kΩ + 3.3kΩ)) = 3.0V

```
Hall Sensor (5V)
     │
     │ 5V signal
     │
     ├─── R1 (2.2kΩ) ───┬─── GPIO 0 (ESP32-C3)
     │                  │
     │                  R2 (3.3kΩ)
     │                  │
    GND ────────────────┴─── GND (ESP32-C3)
```

**Wiring Table**:

| Component | Connection | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Hall Sensor VCC | 5V supply | External 5V, not from ESP32 |
| Hall Sensor GND | Common GND | Shared with ESP32 |
| Hall Sensor Signal | R1 (2.2kΩ) | Start of divider |
| R1 other end | R2 (3.3kΩ) + GPIO 0 | Divider junction |
| R2 other end | GND | Complete divider |
| ESC PWM Input | GPIO 1 | Direct connection (3.3V compatible) |
| ESC GND | Common GND | Shared with ESP32 |

#### ESP32-C3 Simulator Wiring (Two Boards)

**Board 1: Controller** | **Board 2: Simulator**
- GPIO 1 (PWM Out) → GPIO 0 (PWM In)
- GPIO 0 (RPM In) ← GPIO 1 (RPM Out)
- GND → GND (common ground)

Both boards use 3.3V logic, so no voltage divider needed for board-to-board communication.

## PID Tuning Process

### Method 1: Arduino Uno Live Tuning (Recommended)

**Setup**:
1. Wire 4 potentiometers to A0-A3 (see wiring section)
2. Connect mode switch to Pin 3 (switch to GND = tuning mode)
3. Upload Arduino Uno sketch
4. Open Serial Plotter: Tools → Serial Plotter (115200 baud)

**Procedure**:
1. **Enable Tuning Mode**:
   - Close mode switch (connect Pin 3 to GND)
   - Serial Plotter shows: Current RPM, Target RPM, PWM Value

2. **Set Target RPM**:
   - Adjust A3 potentiometer
   - Watch target line change on plotter

3. **Tune Kp (Proportional)**:
   - Start with Kp pot at minimum
   - Slowly increase until motor reaches target RPM
   - Continue increasing until oscillation occurs
   - Reduce by 30-50% for stability
   - Record value from Serial Plotter

4. **Tune Ki (Integral)**:
   - Start with Ki pot at minimum
   - Slowly increase until steady-state error disappears
   - If oscillation occurs, reduce slightly
   - Record value

5. **Tune Kd (Derivative)**:
   - Usually keep low (10-20% of Kp)
   - Increase slightly if overshoot occurs
   - Too much Kd causes instability
   - Record value

6. **Verify**:
   - Test various target RPMs
   - Apply load changes (manually slow motor)
   - Ensure quick recovery without overshoot

7. **Record Values**:
   - Note optimal Kp, Ki, Kd from Serial Plotter
   - Update `config.h` for production deployment

### Method 2: Manual Tuning (All Platforms)

**Setup**:
1. Edit `config.h` and set initial values:
   ```cpp
   #define DEFAULT_KP  0.100
   #define DEFAULT_KI  0.000
   #define DEFAULT_KD  0.000
   ```
2. Upload and observe motor behavior

**Ziegler-Nichols Method**:
1. **Find Ultimate Gain (Ku)**:
   - Set Ki and Kd to 0
   - Increase Kp until continuous oscillation occurs
   - Record Kp value as Ku
   - Record oscillation period as Tu (seconds)

2. **Calculate Initial Values**:
   - Kp = 0.6 × Ku
   - Ki = 1.2 × Ku / Tu
   - Kd = 0.075 × Ku × Tu

3. **Fine-Tune**:
   - Start with calculated values
   - Adjust each gain incrementally
   - Test under various loads and speeds

**Behavior Guidelines**:

| Symptom | Adjustment |
|---------|------------|
| Slow response | Increase Kp |
| Oscillation | Decrease Kp |
| Steady-state error | Increase Ki |
| Slow oscillation | Decrease Ki |
| Overshoot | Increase Kd (slightly) |
| High-frequency noise | Decrease Kd |

### Method 3: BLE Tuning (ESP32-C3 BLE Only)

**Setup**:
1. Upload `esp32-c3/control_ble/control_ble.ino`
2. Install nRF Connect (Android) or LightBlue (iOS)

**Procedure**:
1. Scan for "BLDC-PID" device
2. Connect to device
3. Navigate to Target characteristic
4. Write new RPM value (e.g., "1800")
5. Monitor Status characteristic for real-time feedback
6. Adjust target repeatedly to test response
7. Update PID gains in code if needed (requires reflash)

Note: BLE variant allows target RPM adjustment but not live PID tuning (PID values must be set at compile time).

- [ ] `PWM_MAX_VALUE` not exceeding ESC limits
- [ ] Target RPM reasonable for motor type

### During Operation

**Monitor**:
- Motor temperature (should be warm, not hot to touch)
- ESC temperature (check heat sink temperature)
- Power supply voltage (should remain stable)
- Abnormal sounds (grinding, clicking, high-pitched whine)

**Warning Signs**:
- Excessive vibration → Stop immediately, check balance
- Smoke or burning smell → Cut power, investigate
- Motor stalling → Reduce load or increase PWM threshold
- Erratic behavior → Check for loose connections or noise

### Emergency Procedures

**If Motor Runs Away** (accelerates uncontrollably):
1. Disconnect power immediately
2. Do not attempt to grab motor or propeller
3. Check wiring (especially Hall sensor polarity)
4. Verify PID output isn't inverted

**If No Response**:
1. Check PWM signal with oscilloscope or LED
2. Verify Hall sensor provides pulses (oscilloscope)
3. Test ESC separately (known-good PWM source)
4. Confirm microcontroller powered and running

**If Unstable**:
1. Reduce all PID gains by 50%
2. Add filtering (increase EMA alpha or enable median filter)
3. Check for electrical noise (capacitors on sensor inputs)
4. Verify solid ground connections

## Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

### Programming Issues

**ATtiny85 "Programmer Not Responding"**:
- Verify 10µF capacitor between Arduino Reset and GND
- Check ISP wiring (MOSI, MISO, SCK, RESET)
- Try lower baud rate: Tools → Programmer → "Arduino as ISP (slow)"
- Ensure Arduino has ArduinoISP sketch uploaded

**ESP32-C3 "Failed to Connect"**:
- Press and hold BOOT button, then press RESET
- Try different USB cable (must support data, not just power)
- Install USB serial drivers (CP210x or CH340)
- Select correct port (may be different from Arduino Uno)

### Hardware Issues

**No RPM Reading**:
- Test Hall sensor separately (should output pulses when motor turns)
- Verify sensor powered correctly (5V or 3.3V depending on sensor)
- Check interrupt pin connection (Arduino Pin 2, ATtiny PB3, ESP32 GPIO 0)
- Use oscilloscope to verify pulse signal

**Motor Doesn't Start**:
- Increase `PWM_MIN_THRESHOLD` in code (try 60-80)
- Test ESC separately with servo tester
- Verify ESC calibration (some ESCs need throttle range setup)
- Check power supply capacity (may brownout during startup)

**Incorrect RPM Reading** (off by factor of 2 or 3):
- Verify motor pole count
- Adjust `PULSES_PER_REV`:
  - 8-pole motor = 4
  - 12-pole motor = 6
  - 3-Hall sensors, reading 1 = poles/2
- Use tachometer to confirm actual RPM

For additional troubleshooting, see [Troubleshooting Guide](mitigation.md).

## Next Steps

After successful assembly and tuning:

1. **Document Your Setup**: Record PID values, motor specs, and wiring
2. **Extended Testing**: Run for 30+ minutes, monitor temperatures
3. **Load Testing**: Gradually increase load, verify stability
4. **Production Deployment**: Transfer to ATtiny85 or ESP32-C3
5. **Maintenance**: Periodic inspection of connections and components
